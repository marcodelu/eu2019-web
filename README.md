# ElectionStats

Explore (dis)similarities between countries on political orientation, and the relative share of voice on many hot topics around Europe!

ElectionStats is an application to track and analyze the progress of 2019 European elections through Twitter.

This tool monitored in real-time 800 keywords and collected 22 million tweets. The data was then processed, aggregated, and presented through various charts.

The structure consists of the frontend, developed in Angular 7; the backend, based on Python; and a Mongo database.

The project was realized in collaboration with Andrea Antonacci (data analyst), sponsored by Tilburg School of Economics and Management and mentored by Dr. Hannes Datta.
