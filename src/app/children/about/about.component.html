    <h1>About the project</h1>
    <p>
      This tool visualizes data at the aggregate level from tweets on the current European Elections and allows anyone to explore
      (dis)similarities between countries on political orientation, as well as the relative share of voice on many hot topics around Europe!
      Many new charts and insights are currently under development — check back frequently!
      The data is based on a sample of all Tweets, and automatically updated approximately every 15 minutes. There is no need to refresh the
      page.<br> <br>
      This project is a student initiative of Tilburg School of Economics and Management, developed by
      <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/andreantonacci/">Andrea Antonacci</a> (Master of Science student in Marketing Management at Tilburg
      University), <a href="https://marcodelucchi.com">Marco De Lucchi</a> (Web developer), and mentored by
      <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/h-datta">Hannes Datta</a> (Associate Professor at Tilburg University).
      Special thanks go to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enricogiulini/">Enrico Giulini</a> for his helpful
      contribution, and to faculty at Tilburg School of Economics and Management for providing feedback.<br>
      The project’s infrastructure is supported with research funds from Tilburg School of Economics and Management in the interest of
      encouraging entrepreneurship among students, and to generate a large body of data for students’ to write their Master theses on.

    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    The collection of data started on 5/16/2019 at 12:50:00 UTC. <br>
    We track approximately 800 different keywords from the current stream of tweets via Twitter Realtime API. These include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        general hashtags on the elections (in all the different languages spoken in the EU): e.g., #EUElections, #EUvaalit2019, #EP2019,
        etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        all the European Parliament groups’ usernames and official hashtags: e.g., @ALDE, #ALDE, @EPP, #EPP, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        all the major national parties’ usernames (having at least a seat in the national parliament): e.g., @groen, @PdA_Austria,
        @LegaSalvini, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        all the national party’s leaders’ usernames: e.g, @theresa_may, @luigidimaio, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        keywords on hot topics and challenges faced by the EU (in all the different languages spoken in the EU): e.g, migration, Brexit,
        single market, unemployment, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Our current set of keywords is available for download <a href="https://api.electionstats.eu/complete_hashtags.csv" target="_blank">here</a>.
      <br> <br>
      To compute an average political orientation score per country shown in the first chart, we assigned a political orientation score to
      each national party, ranging from 1 (far left) to 5 (far right).
      This classification is purely based on our own research effort on national parties. We classified parties as far left/right when they
      showed (extreme) political positions (e.g., anti-immigration, anti-establishment, anti-élite attitudes, populism, euroscepticism,
      etc.). Please, reach us if you do not agree with our current classification of a party. <br> <br>

    <h1>Limitations</h1>
    <p>
      Please, notice that we do not do text mining of tweets. Instead, we simply count the number of tweets that contain a certain keyword
      of interest. Despite being less accurate, this approach turned out to be the most appropriate for real-time data visualization.

      <br> <br>

      In our data, we do not observe a user’s country of origin; we only observe the language of a Tweet, which we use as a proxy for a
      user’s nationality. As languages do not directly correspond to countries (e.g., in some countries, multiple languages are spoken), we
      have decided to drop the following countries in certain cases: Belgium, Croatia, Luxembourg, Malta. <br>
      Instead, in some other charts, we aggregate countries speaking the same language (e.g., Austria and Germany, Greece and Republic of
      Cyprus, Ireland and United Kingdom).
