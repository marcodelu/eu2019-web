    <h1>About the project</h1>
    <p>This tool visualizes data at aggregate level from tweets on the current European Elections and allows anyone to explore
      (dis)similarities between countries on political orientation, as well as the relative share of voice on many hot topics around Europe!
      <br>
      Many new charts and insights are currently under development — check back soon! <br>
      Data is automatically updated approximately every 15 minutes, so there is no need to refresh the page.<br> <br>
      This project is developed by <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/andreantonacci/">Andrea Antonacci</a> (postgraduate at Tilburg
      University), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcodelucchi/">Marco De Lucchi</a> (web developer), and supported by
      <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/h-datta">Hannes Datta</a> (Associate Professor at Tilburg Univerisity). A special
      thank is
      reserved to Enrico Giulini for his helpful contribution.
      The project is funded with contributions from Tilburg University.
    </p>

    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    We track approximately 800 different keywords from the current stream of tweets via Twitter Realtime API. These includes:
    <ul>
      <li>general hashtags on the elections (in all the different languages spoken in the EU): e.g., #EUElections, #EUvaalit2019, #EP2019,
        etc.
      </li>
      <li>all the European Parliament groups’ usernames and official hashtags: e.g., @ALDE, #ALDE, @EPP, #EPP, etc.</li>
      <li>all the major national parties’ usernames (having at least a seat in the national parliament): e.g., @groen, @PdA_Austria,
        @LegaSalvini, etc.
      </li>
      <li>all the national party’s leaders usernames: e.g, @theresa_may, @luigidimaio, etc.</li>
      <li>keywords on hot topics and challenges faced by the EU (in all the different languages spoken in the EU): e.g, migration, Brexit,
        single market, unemployment, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Limitations</h1>
    <p>Some charts may include data for only 21 countries. That is because we use the tweet language to infer the user nationality. <br>
      Unfortunately, this is not appropriate for some countries where more than a language is spoken (e.g, Belgium), and thus we decided to
      drop them in certain cases.
